["index.html", "Introduction 1 Introduction 1.1 Regression Cheat Sheet", " Introduction 1 Introduction Simple linear regression is a fancy term for “putting a line on a scatterplot of data.” For example, the line shown on the scatterplot below is often called a “linear regression line.” There is a rich mathematical theory behind linear regression. And experience has shown that the more deeply you connect with this theory, the more powerfully you can perform predictive data modeling and analysis. The goal of this course is to introduce you to this rich theory from a high level perspective. The more math you have studied prior to the course, the more deeply you will be able to connect with this “rich theory” behind linear regression. Still, even if you have but little experience in mathematics, this course should help you connect with the theory deeply enough that you will be able to appropriately use linear regression in applied applications. 1.1 Regression Cheat Sheet Past students have found the following table of terms, pronunciation guides, and so on to be useful reminders about things they learn in the course. You could skip over this table right now. It is most powerfully used by revisiting it as you work through each lesson in the course. Your eventual goal is to become very familiar with every element demonstrated within this table.
